To run it locally:

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).  
`gem install jekyll bundler`
2. Build the site and make it available on a local server  
`bundle exec jekyll serve  --config _config.yml,_config_development.yml`

In example above you can switch part of your config settings depending on the environment, settings in later files override settings in earlier files.
