## Why documentation is left behind and outdated?

When it is time to go, but you still have to document.

We cannot deny that good documentation will make teams more agile delivering and supporting software, it will be more easy to onboard new members on the team as well, but from another end, to be agile we need to produce working code over documentation. In other [article](./what-is-unified-modeling-language-UML) I mentioned that modeling (as part of documentation), many times is left behind and is not updated continuously. This is left behind because once development starts, developers are not updating these models, that is done by the technical lead (a.k.a. system architect, product owner, product manager, etc.), and this is not done by the people implementing because they are focused on [delivering working software over documenting](https://agilemanifesto.org), right? The chicken and the egg dilemma.

In the [_art of scalability_](http://theartofscalability.com/) book, authors states that scalability is much more related to the people rather than technology, that good people and **good process** lead to a _Great Technology Virtuous Cycle_. Any software that continuously evolves need to define how the continuous improvement will be managed, it is required a cultural and process change that includes documentation as an important part of deliverables, otherwise the code will evolve leading to obsolete documentation. You need to building documentation like code.

## Hello Continuous Documentation

If you are continuously delivering, then, you must be continuously documenting, Continuous documentation as part of the delivery and implementation process requires:

1. Documentation explicitly includes examples of code with snippets, configuration paths and files, any explicit reference that enable new members an experiences similar to getting first-hand explanation from the person that implemented the code originally.
2. As the code evolves the documentation needs to be on sync with the state of the codebase.
3. Team needs to stop procrastinating and create the habit of documenting after every sprint or new features or fix had been applied in the code.

There are many different ways to resolve a problem or different ways to use a tool, if you don't document how you expect the end user or a system integrator to use your software, then, they will end up using it in bizarre ways you never imagined.
