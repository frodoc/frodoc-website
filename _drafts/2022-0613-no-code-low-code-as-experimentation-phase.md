## No Code - Low Code

What developers like? Isn't that obvious? They love to develop!

Developers are still required to implement the details or granular parts on the applications, then, the no-code or low-code won't be the silver bullet to implement business applications, because, what will happen when a no code application will require to be integrated with any other application or when the startup phase had been overpass the capacity of this "testing ideas phase".

Of course, you need to start validating your ideas and in that sense you will need to use no code platforms, because your main goal should be to ship a business idea and model.

What happen when the sunny day scenarios start failing, because you don't have control on what no-code solutions start changing?
What happen when you need more complex validations?

Low-code is not another thing but an automation for specific task, i.e. capturing user general data (forms), payment processing.
